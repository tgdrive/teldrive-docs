# Installation

Teldrive can be installed directly on your system using our one-line installers. If you prefer Docker, skip this section and proceed to the [Usage Guide](/docs/getting-started/usage.md).

## One-Line Installers

Choose the appropriate installation method for your operating system:

::: code-group
```sh [macOS/Linux (curl)]
curl -sSL instl.vercel.app/tgdrive/teldrive | bash
```

```powershell [PowerShell/cmd.exe]
powershell -c "irm https://instl.vercel.app/tgdrive/teldrive?platform=windows|iex"
```
:::

The installer will download the latest Teldrive binary and set it up on your system. Once installed, you can run Teldrive from any terminal window.

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that Teldrive is installed correctly:

```sh
teldrive version
```

This should display the current version of Teldrive.

## Next Steps

Now that you have installed Teldrive, proceed to the [Usage Guide](/docs/getting-started/usage.md) to set up your configuration and start using Teldrive.
